# docker-images


Collection of docker images I am currently working on and tweaking.  
<HR>  

## Purpose  
Mostly as examples and templates for creating images for performing datascience, bioinformatics, and in particular single cell RNA-sequencing.  

<HR>

## Usage  
Clone the repository.  
Navigate to the folder that contains the image you wish to build.  
Either build the image using the ```Dockerfile``` or build/run using the ```dockercompose.yml``` file with preconfigured run settings.
```
docker build . -t <tag_name>
docker run <tag_name>
```
or  
```
docker compose up
```
